# DigiPig

A money learning app for kids. Think piggy bank, but digital.

Kids get real-feeling debit and credit cards (NFC tags) they can hold, tap, and use — while parents manage the accounts behind the scenes.

## What it does

- Track balances across multiple accounts
- Add and deduct funds
- Issue NFC-powered cards for a tangible experience
- All transactions use **oinks** as currency
